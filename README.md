# **Detection of Dementia from Brain Scans**

You will find the complete machine learning workflow [here](https://github.com/abdulmalikadeyemo/Source_Code_Premier_project/blob/main/Dementia_ML_Flow_Process.ipynb)

A demo? I got you. [Demo](https://abdulmalikadeyemo-dementia-deploy-krh1e8.streamlit.app/)

**In this project, I led a team of 20 interns in the development, evaluation, and deployment of a dementia prediction model based on a tabular dataset of 150 subjects aged 60 to 96.**

#### Problem Statement:

As the seventh leading cause of mortality and one of the main causes of disability and dependency among older people worldwide, dementia is frequently unrecognized and misunderstood, which leads to stigmatization and barriers to diagnosis and care.
