# **Detection of Dementia from Brain Scans**
   
## **Introduction**

When thinking, memory, and reasoning skills are lost to the point where they interfere with day-to-day tasks, this condition is known as dementia. Some dementia patients have emotional instability and personality changes. The intensity of dementia varies from the mildest stage, when it is just starting to interfere with a person's ability to function, to the most severe level, when the individual must fully rely on others for fundamental daily activities.

Various disorders and factors contribute to the development of dementia. Neurodegenerative disorders result in a progressive and irreversible loss of neurons and brain functioning. Currently, there are no cures for these diseases.

The five most common forms of dementia are:

*   Alzheimerâ€™s disease, It is caused by changes in the brain, including abnormal buildups of proteins, known as amyloid plaques and tau tangles.
*   Frontotemporal dementia, It is associated with abnormal amounts or forms of the proteins tau and TDP-43.
*   Lewy body dementia, a form of dementia caused by abnormal deposits of the protein alpha-synuclein, called Lewy bodies.
*   Vascular dementia, a form of dementia caused by conditions that damage blood vessels in the brain or interrupt the flow of blood and oxygen to the brain.
*   Mixed dementia, a combination of two or more types of dementia.

**In this project, I led a team of 20 interns in the development, evaluation, and deployment of a dementia prediction model based on a tabular dataset of 150 subjects aged 60 to 96.**

#### Problem Statement:

As the seventh leading cause of mortality and one of the main causes of disability and dependency among older people worldwide, dementia is frequently unrecognized and misunderstood, which leads to stigmatization and barriers to diagnosis and care.
